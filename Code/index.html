                            <h2>A drawing joke</h2>
                            <p>Several kings and great lords are made mention of as being particularly fond of using the
                                lancet. Peter the Great of Russia was remarkably fond of witnessing dissections and
                                surgical operations. He even used to carry a case
                                of instruments in his pocket. He often visited the hospitals to witness capital
                                operations, at times assisting in person, and was able to dissect properly, to bleed a
                                patient, and extract a tooth as well as one of the faculty.</p>

                            <p>The pretty wife of one of the czar's valets had the following unpleasant experience of
                                his skill. The husband of the "maid" accused her of flirting, and vowed revenge. The
                                czar noticed the valet seated in the ante-room, looking
                                forlorn, and asked the cause of his dejection. The wicked valet replied that his wife
                                had a tooth which gave her great pain, keeping them both awake day and night, but would
                                not have it drawn.</p>

                            <p>"Send her to me," said the czar.</p>

                            <p>The woman was brought, but persisted in affirming that her teeth were sound, and never
                                ached. The valet alleged that this was always the way she did when the physician was
                                called; therefore, in spite of her cries and remonstrances,
                                the king ordered her husband to hold her head between his knees, when the czar drew out
                                his instruments and instantly extracted the tooth designated by the husband,
                                disregarding the cries of the unfortunate victim.
                            </p>

                            <p>In a few days the czar was informed that the thing was a put-up job by the jealous
                                husband, in order to punish, if not mar the beauty of, his gallant wife, whereupon the
                                instruments were again brought into requisition; and
                                this time the naughty valet was the sufferer, to the extent of losing a sound and
                                valuable tooth.</p>

                            <h2>Commencing practice</h2>
                            <p>From that excellent work, "Scenes in the Practice of a New York Surgeon," by Dr. E. H.
                                Dixon, I copy, with some abbreviation, the following, which the author terms "Leaves
                                from the Log-book of an Unfledged Æsculapian:"--</p>

                            <p>"In the year 1830 I was sent forth, like our long-suffering and much-abused
                                prototype,--old father Noah's crow,--from the ark of safety, the old St. Duane Street
                                College. I pitched my tent, and set up my trap, in what was then
                                a fashionable up-town street.</p>

                            <p>"I hired a modest house, and had my arm-chair, my midnight couch, and my few books in my
                                melancholy little office, and I confess that I now and then left an amputating-knife, or
                                some other awful-looking instrument, on the table,
                                to impress the poor women who came to me for advice.</p>

                            <p>"These little matters, although the 'Academy' would frown upon them, I considered quite
                                pardonable. God knows I would willingly have adopted their most approved method of a
                                splendid residence, and silver-mounted harnesses for
                                my bays; but they were yet in dream-land, eating moonbeams, and my vicious little nag
                                had nearly all this time to eat his oats and nurse his bad temper in his comfortable
                                stable.</p>

                            <p>"In this miserable way I read over my old books, watered my rose-bushes,--sometimes with
                                tears,--drank my tea and ate my toast, and occasionally listened to the complaint of an
                                unfortunate Irish damsel, with her customary account
                                of 'a pain in me side an' a flutterin' about me heart.' At rare intervals I ministered
                                to some of her countrywomen in their fulfilment of the great command when placed in the
                                Garden of Eden. (What a dirty place it would
                                have been if inhabited by Irish women!)</p>

                            <p>"And thus I spent nearly a year without a single call to any person of character. I think
                                I should have left in despair if it had not been for a lovely creature up the street.
                                She was the wife of a distinguished fish merchant
                                down town.</p>

                            <p>"This lovely woman was Mrs. Mackerel. I will explain how it was that I was summoned to
                                her ladyship's mansion, and had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Mackerel, of the firm of
                                'Mackerel, Haddock &amp; Dun.'</p>

                            <p>"One bitter cold night in January, just as I was about to retire, a furious ring at the
                                front door made me feel particularly amiable! A servant announced the sudden and
                                alarming illness of Mrs. Mackerel, with the assurance
                                that as the family physician was out of town, Mrs. M. would be obliged if I would
                                immediately visit her. Accordingly, I soon found myself in the presence of the
                                accomplished lady, having--I confess it--given my hair an
                                extra touch as I entered the beautiful chamber.</p>

                            <p>"Mrs. Mackerel was not a bad-tempered lady; she was only a beautiful fool--nothing less,
                                dear reader, or she would have never married old Mackerel. Her charms would have
                                procured her a husband of at least a tolerable exterior.
                                His physiognomy presented a remarkable resemblance to his namesake. Besides, he chewed
                                and smoked, and the combination of the aroma of his favorite luxuries with the articles
                                of his merchandise must have been most uncongenial
                                to the curve of such lips and such nostrils as Mrs. Mackerel's.</p>

                            <p>"I was received by Mr. Mackerel in a manner that increased observation has since taught
                                me is sufficiently indicative of the hysterical _finale_ of a domestic dialogue. He was
                                not so obtuse as to let me directly into the true
                                cause of his wife's nervous attack and his own collectedness, and yet he felt it would
                                not answer to make too light of it before me.</p>

                            <p>"Mr. and Mrs. M. had just returned from a party. (The party must be the 'scape-goat'!) He
                                assured me that as the lady was in the full enjoyment of health previously, he felt
                                obliged to attribute the cause of her attack and
                                speechless condition--for she spoke not one word, or gave a sign--to the dancing, heated
                                room, and the supper.</p>

                            <p>"I was fully prepared to realize the powers of ice-cream, cake, oranges, chicken-salad,
                                oysters, sugar-plums, punch, and champagne, and at one moment almost concluded to
                                despatch a servant for an emetic of ipecac; but--I prudently
                                avoided it. Aside from the improbability of excess of appetite through the portal of
                                such a mouth, the lovely color of the cheeks and lips utterly forbade a conclusion
                                favorable to Mr. Mackerel's solution of the cause.</p>

                            <p>"I placed my finger on her delicate and jewelled wrist. All seemed calm as the thought of
                                an angel's breast!

                                <p>"I was nonplussed. 'Could any tumultuous passion ever have agitated that bosom so
                                    gently swelling in repose?'</p>

                                <p>"Mackerel's curious questions touching my sagacity as to his wife's condition
                                    received about as satisfactory a solution as do most questions put to me on the
                                    cause and treatment of diseases; and having tolerably befogged
                                    him with opinions, and lulled his suspicions to rest, by the apparent innocent
                                    answers to his leading questions, he arrived at the conclusion most desirable to
                                    him, viz., that I was a fool--a conviction quite necessary
                                    in some nervous cases....</p>

                                <p>"So pleased was Mr. M. with the soothing influences of my brief visit that he very
                                    courteously waited on me to the outside door, instead of ordering a servant to show
                                    me out, and astonished me by desiring me to call on
                                    the patient again in the morning.</p>

                                <p>"After my usual diversion of investigating 'a pain an' a flutterin' about me heart,'
                                    and an 'O, I'm kilt intirely,' I visited Mrs. Mackerel, and had the extreme pleasure
                                    of finding her quite composed, and in conversation
                                    with her fashionable friend, Mrs. Tiptape. The latter was the daughter of a 'retired
                                    milliner,' and had formed a desirable union with Tiptape, the eminent dry goods
                                    merchant. Fortunately--for she was a woman of influence--I
                                    passed the critical examination of Mrs. T. unscathed by her sharp black eyes, and,
                                    as the sequel will show, was considered by her 'quite an agreeable person.'</p>

                                <p>"Poor Mrs. Mackerel, notwithstanding her efforts to conceal it, had evidently
                                    received some cruel and stunning communication from her husband on the night of my
                                    summons; her agitated circulation during the fortnight of
                                    my attendance showed to my conviction some persistent and secret cause for her
                                    nervousness.</p>

                                <p>"One evening she assured me that she felt she should now rapidly recover, as Mr.
                                    Mackerel had concluded to take her to Saratoga. I, of course, acquiesced in the
                                    decision, though my previous opinion had not been asked. I
                                    took a final leave of the lovely woman, and the poor child soon departed for
                                    Saratoga.</p>

                                <p>"The ensuing week there was a sheriff's sale at Mackerel's residence. The day
                                    following the Mackerels' departure, Mr. Tiptape did me the honor to inquire after
                                    the health of my family; and a week later, Master Tiptape having
                                    fallen and bumped his dear nose on the floor, I had the felicity of soothing the
                                    anguish of his mamma in her magnificent _boudoir_, and holding to her lovely nose
                                    the smelling salts, and offering such consolation as
                                    her trying position required!"</p>

                                <p>Thus was commenced the practice of one of the first physicians of New York. The facts
                                    are avouched for. The names, of course, are manufactured, to cover the occupation of
                                    the parties. The doctor still lives, in the enjoyment
                                    of a lucrative and respectable practice, and the love and confidence of his numerous
                                    friends and patrons.</p>

                                <p>Quite as ludicrous scenes could be revealed by most physicians, if they would but
                                    take the time to think over their earlier efforts, and the various circumstances
                                    which were mainly instrumental in getting them into a respectable
                                    practice.
                                </p>
